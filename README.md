# Conway's Game of Life for terminals

I've decided to recreate Conway's Game of Life for the nth time but inside of the terminal.

## Phases of implementation:

### First Phase:

For the first phase, I plan to just make it work with a single seed and it to be very manual and not very pretty in the terminal.

### Second Phase:

For the second phase, I plan to integrate ncurses and generate user defined seeds so that it can run on there.

### Third Phase:

For the third phase, I plan to prettify the whole application and add additional stuff such as ANSI colors, get data on how the seed performed, show generation data and time elapsed data and potentially add a heatmap to gleam information on it.
